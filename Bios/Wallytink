Abigail Finn - I have next to no programming experience, but I am eager to learn. I was supposed to be taught some programming a while ago, but the people I was with never actually taught me anything. I am a huge nerd (movies, books, anime, Dungeons and Dragons, etc.), and I am pretty intelligent in my, and my friends', opinion.
