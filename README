This repository is to put a name to username, keep track of the actions done by users, and to help introduce the new users to Github.
This repository is open to everyone in the group. That way, they can edit their "bio" and view their statistics.

A couple rules for this repository:
Only owners should edit the README
The bio's are open to everyone, please do not edit anyone else's bio (we can see if you did)
Owners should keep this repository up to date. Statistics, contributions, users, and bios should be updated and/or archived

A couple rules for the future:
Unless you're uncomforatable keeping your bio up after you graduate, Don't delete it! Previous bios leave a history of robotics and contribute to the culture
Everything should be archived and cleaned at the end of the school year. That way the next owner(s) do(es) not have to deal with last year's mess

Rules may be edited, added, and deleted, because every year will be different. However, I wouldn't recommend changing anything unless it's absolutely neccesary.

How to make a bio:
1.	Create a new document, and name it your username. If you forgot your username, it's always at the top of the page (github.com/<YOUR USERNAME>/...)
2.	Type your name in the document, so we can connect usernames to people
3.	Type anything you want about yourself. Things you should include (you don't HAVE to, no one's grading you) are:
		How much programming experience you have
		What made you interested in robotics or programing?
	Optional, more fun stuff includes:
		What's your biggest pet-peeve?
		What's your worst programming story?
	Of course, you can write as much or as little as you want, this is all personal. Just remember that everyone can see what you write down.
